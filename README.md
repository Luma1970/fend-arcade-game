## Notes

I'm late with the project so I've developed only the basic game for now, but I plan to develop some advanced features in future ;-)

## Contributing

There are plenty of gadgets to add to this game. But this is a study project so I want to keep only my code. However if you have some suggestion or ideas they would be welcome.
